# Context
- Amazon are catching up to reused epubs. On Reddit, a fix was established, and my goal is to make it simple as possible.
- The script will convert an epub to mobi then back to change hash, bypassing Amazons anti piracy measures 
- This script was created by ChatGPT A.I
# Prerequisite
- You need to have Calibre installed: https://calibre-ebook.com/
# How TO RUN
- Run program with your favourite python gui/command line
# How TO USE
- The script will ask where the epub is, then once the epub converts to a mobi, then convert back to epub. ~~the script will ask again where the mobi is ~~(Will make it easier in the future)~~ FIXED
