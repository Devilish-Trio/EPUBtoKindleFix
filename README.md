# Context
Amazon is catching up to reused e-books in the epub format, which can be a problem for people who have legitimately purchased e-books and want to use them on multiple devices. On Reddit, someone found a fix for this issue, and my goal is to explain it in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

The fix involves using a script that converts an epub file to a mobi file, and then back to an epub file. This process changes the hashed epub file, making it unique and bypassing Amazon's anti-piracy measures. This allows people who have legitimately purchased e-books in the epub format to use them on multiple devices without any issues.

# Prerequisite
- You need to have Calibre installed: https://calibre-ebook.com/
# How TO RUN
- Run program with your favourite python gui/command line
# How TO USE
- The script will ask where the epub is, then once the epub converts to a mobi, then convert back to epub. ~~the script will ask again where the mobi is (Will make it easier in the future)~~ FIXED
